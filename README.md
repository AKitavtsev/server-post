# sercer-post

This repo contains a RESTful service written in Haskell as requested by MetaLamp (https://rizzoma.com/topic/c27faf1cfa188c1120f59af4c35e6099/0_b_9n8n_8jl2l/).


## Intructions to set up and run

`Stack` was used for managing the packages, it is a fantastic tool that just works. You can find instructions on how to install [here](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/).

After installing `Stack`, clone this repo and `cd` into the project. In order to build the project, run
```
# download the compiler if needed
stack setup 

# build the project
stack build 
```

That's it! And then when you want to run the service at a port 3000:
```
stack exec server-post-exe
```


You can run the tests with:
```
stack test
```

## Project structure

- `app/Main.hs` - Prepares configs and handles and transfers control to the`Router`
- `haskell-checking-account.cabal` - `cabal` file automatically generated by `Stack`
- `package.yaml` - the file where we add all the dependencies and project metadata
- `stack.yaml` - `Stack` configuration
- `src` - contains all the code used by this service
    - `Router` - the main router, which will determine the essence of the request and transfer control to the appropriate controller
	- `FromRequst` - common functions used by other modules
    - `Controllers/` - controllers and routers of entities and additional endpoints
    - `Models/` - the entity models that our application uses (e.g. `User`, `Post`)
    - `Servises/` - Services required for the functioning of the application (e.g.`Logger, Config, DB)` 
      - `Impl/` - service implementations
- `test` - our specs, for testing some internal functions. 
- `sql` - sql database migration queries. Database is built and minimal initial seeding is ensured
- 'bat' - batch files for easy testing of the application. Contains requests to the server passed by the `curl` utility for all endpoints of mseh entities (for Windows). In addition, `migration.bat` is a request for migration, a `test.bat` is a series of requests to fill the database for testing filtering and sorting of posts, `where-order.bat` - examples of tests for filtering and sorting of posts, `token.bat` - to refresh the token.
- `image` - folder from which you can upload photos to the database.

## Database
A [`TVar`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/stm-2.5.0.0/docs/Control-Concurrent-STM-TVar.html) was used for storing our database. It provides atomic concurrency-safe transactions. It is bootstrapped during the server startup, and helper functions in `src/Core.hs` allow it to be accessed in a transactional way.


## Endpoints

### POST /accounts

Creates an account. It requires an `owner` String in the body. The account ID returned is needed for all the following requests.

It fails with `400` if there is no `owner` passed.

```
curl -v -X POST http://localhost:3000/accounts -d '{"owner": "kostis"}'

# POST /accounts
# {
#   "owner": "kostis"
# }
#
# 200 OK
# {
#   "status": "success",
#   "data": {
#     "owner": "kostis",
#     "id": "dfcf2ebe-4923-4b49-ac12-7de0734daa4b",
#     "type": "Account"
#   }
# }
```

### GET /accounts

Gets an account. Nothing too exciting. It returns `404` if the account does not exist.

```
curl -v http://localhost:3000/accounts/dfcf2ebe-4923-4b49-ac12-7de0734daa4b

# GET /accounts/dfcf2ebe-4923-4b49-ac12-7de0734daa4b
#
# 200 OK
# {
#   "status": "success",
#   "data": {
#     "owner": "kostis",
#     "id": "dfcf2ebe-4923-4b49-ac12-7de0734daa4b",
#     "type": "Account"
#   }
# }
```

### POST /operations

It creates an operation for an account. The operation type can be either credit or debit. `amount` always appears as positive. It also requires an `accountId`, an ISO8601 `date`, and a `decription`. 

They service supports creating operations in any order, as they are stored in a `Set` in the background.

If one of these fields is missing, `accountId` does not correspond to a created account, `amount` is negative, `operationType` is not either `"credit"` or `"debit"`, it fails with `400`.

```
curl -v -X POST http://localhost:3000/operations -d '{"accountId": "dfcf2ebe-4923-4b49-ac12-7de0734daa4b", "operationType": "debit", "amount": 1000, "date": "2019-07-21", "description": "airline tickets to New York"}'

# POST /operations
# {
#   "accountId": "dfcf2ebe-4923-4b49-ac12-7de0734daa4b",
#   "operationType": "debit",
#   "amount": 1000,
#   "date": "2019-07-21",
#   "description": "airline tickets to New York"
# }
#
# 200 OK
# {
#   "status": "success",
#   "data": {
#     "amount": 1000,
#     "date": "2019-07-21",
#     "accountId": "dfcf2ebe-4923-4b49-ac12-7de0734daa4b",
#     "id": "4f2f24bd-5ca5-43b1-8249-f84f6c1bde97",
#     "operationType": "debit",
#     "type": "Operation",
#     "description": "airline tickets to New York"
#   }
# }
```

### GET /accounts/:id/balance

Retrieve the account's balance. Fails with `404` if there's no account with such ID.

```
curl -v http://localhost:3000/accounts/dfcf2ebe-4923-4b49-ac12-7de0734daa4b/balance

# GET /accounts/dfcf2ebe-4923-4b49-ac12-7de0734daa4b/balance
#
# 200 OK
# {
#   "status": "success",
#   "data": -700.0
# }
```

### GET /accounts/:id/statement

Get an accounts bank statement. `fromDate` and `toDate` query params are used to pass ISO8601 date strings that define the start and end (included) of the statement. 

If the query params are missing, they're not ISO8601 strings, or `fromDate` is greater than `toDate`, the request fails with `400`. If there is no account with such ID, it fails with `404`. 

```
curl -v "http://localhost:3000/accounts/dfcf2ebe-4923-4b49-ac12-7de0734daa4b/statement?fromDate=2018-01-01&toDate=2020-01-01"

# GET /accounts/dfcf2ebe-4923-4b49-ac12-7de0734daa4b/statement?fromDate=2018-01-01&toDate=2020-01-01
#
# 200 OK
# {
#   "status": "success",
#   "data": {
#     "fromDate": "2018-01-01",
#     "toDate": "2020-01-01",
#     "statementDates": [
#       {
#         "date": "2019-07-18",
#         "endOfDayBalance": 100,
#         "type": "StatementDate",
#         "operations": [
#           {
#             "amount": 100,
#             "date": "2019-07-18",
#             "accountId": "dfcf2ebe-4923-4b49-ac12-7de0734daa4b",
#             "id": "c8a18269-a212-4b22-8ab6-94e35b13da6c",
#             "operationType": "credit",
#             "type": "Operation",
#             "description": "gift from parents"
#           }
#         ]
#       },
#       {
#         "date": "2019-07-21",
#         "endOfDayBalance": -700.0,
#         "type": "StatementDate",
#         "operations": [
#           {
#             "amount": 1000,
#             "date": "2019-07-21",
#             "accountId": "dfcf2ebe-4923-4b49-ac12-7de0734daa4b",
#             "id": "4f2f24bd-5ca5-43b1-8249-f84f6c1bde97",
#             "operationType": "debit",
#             "type": "Operation",
#             "description": "airline tickets to New York"
#           },
#           {
#             "amount": 200,
#             "date": "2019-07-21",
#             "accountId": "dfcf2ebe-4923-4b49-ac12-7de0734daa4b",
#             "id": "df08838f-d6a6-46f7-9780-032e4f68ac36",
#             "operationType": "credit",
#             "type": "Operation",
#             "description": "some deposit"
#           }
#         ]
#       }
#     ],
#     "type": "Statement"
#   }
# }
```

### GET /accounts/:id/debtPeriods

Returns the all-time periods of debt for the account. Again, it fails with `404` if there there's no account with such ID. 

```
curl -v http://localhost:3000/accounts/dfcf2ebe-4923-4b49-ac12-7de0734daa4b/debtPeriods

# GET /accounts/dfcf2ebe-4923-4b49-ac12-7de0734daa4b/debtPeriods
#
# 200 OK
# {
#   "status": "success",
#   "data": [
#     {
#       "fromDate": "2019-07-21",
#       "toDate": null,
#       "principal": 700.0,
#       "type": "DebtPeriod"
#     }
#   ]
# }
```

## Response envelope

Successful responses have their `status` attribute set to `"success"`, and the requested resource nested inside `data`. Most resources have a `type` declaring what this returned resource is, e.g. `"Account"` or `"DebtPeriod"`. 

Error responses have their `status` attribute set to `"error"`, and a `message` attribute explaining what went wrong.

The API was developed in this way because if we wish at some point to add metadata or other data to the response irrelevant to the resource, it will be trivial.
